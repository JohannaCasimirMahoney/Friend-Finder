# Friend-Finder

### Overview
FriendFinder is a compatibility-based application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. The survey consists of 10 questions and each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.

You will use Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
